# Prognostication and treatment predictions for early-stage breast cancer: incorporating the 70-gene signature into the PREDICT prognostication model

The 70-gene signature (70-GS) has been shown to identify women at low-risk of distant recurrence who can safely forgo adjuvant chemotherapy. Incorporating this GS into the well-validated and widely used PREDICT breast cancer model could improve the model’s ability to estimate breast cancer prognosis, and thereby further reduce overtreatment and its long-term impact on patients’ quality of life. We incorporated the 70-GS into PREDICT-v2.3 and assessed the new PREDICT-GS model’s ability to predict 5-year risk of breast cancer death.

The prognostic effect of 70-GS was obtained from the MINDACT study (for details, see: [https://github.com/annbinuya/PREDICT-NL_Methods])
